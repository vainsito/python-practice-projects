## Introduction

In this repository, I aim to demonstrate the versatility and ease of creating Python applications with GUIs using PySimpleGUI and Tkinter. These projects are designed to be beginner-friendly and serve as examples for those looking to get started with GUI development in Python.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects included in this repository:

1. **Simple To-Do List**: An easy-to-use to-do list application built with PySimpleGUI.

2. **Calculator App**: A basic calculator application with a graphical user interface developed using Tkinter.

3. **Weather App**: A simple weather application that fetches weather data from an API and displays it using Tkinter.

4. **Converter**: A simple Converter with basic measurement units created with PySimpleGUI.

Feel free to explore these projects and use them as a reference for your own GUI development endeavors.

## Usage
```
To use these projects, follow these general steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. Navigate to the specific project directory you're interested in.

3. Run the Python script associated with the project, typically named `main.py`.

4. Interact with the graphical user interface and explore the functionality.

Each project directory may contain additional instructions or dependencies specific to that project.
